# aBot2
A small, simple Discord.JS bot hand crafted with TypeScript.\n

### What exactly is this?
aBot2 is a small discord bot I am making with TypeScript based off my old bot, cleverly named aBot. I intend for this bot to be super easy to develop for, allowing anyone to pick it up with ease. Sort of like a boilerplate in a sense.

# How To Run
Create your .env file in the root directory, and set LoginToken to your bot's token.
Run with ``npm run start``
